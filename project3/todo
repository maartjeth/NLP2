TODO:

1) Extract all features
-- Core features: done
-- Feature combinations: scikit learn
-- Linguistic features: Maartje
-- Sparse data features:

2) Evaluate all sentences
-- Meteor (BLUE?): Bas

3) Pro
-- Implement algorithm to get the features for the SVM: BAS
-- Train SVM weights: Maartje (Done)

4) Final evaluation
-- Rank all sentences based on their weights (= features * weight)
-- Compute score (same as for step 2)
